Traffic Pulze – Traffic Monitoring System

A Python-based traffic data analysis and visualization tool designed to help local councils make informed decisions using real-world traffic datasets.

📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Software Development 1 coursework at the University of Westminster. The system analyzes traffic flow data collected over multiple 24-hour periods from two major junctions:

Elm Avenue / Rabbit Road,
Hanley Highway / Westway,

The dataset includes information such as:

Vehicle type,
Direction of travel,
Speed,
Speed limits,
Weather conditions

🚀 Features

1. CSV Dataset Selection
Prompts users to enter a date and automatically selects the corresponding dataset.
2. Traffic Data Analysis
Calculates useful statistics including vehicle counts, average speeds, speed violations, and weather-related trends.
3. Report Generation
Summarizes the analysis results and saves them into a structured .txt report.
4. Visual Data Representation
Generates histograms and graphs using graphics.py to visualize traffic flow and trends.
